		<div class="row">

				<p class="projects-paragraph">Constructing online surveys and conducting in-person interviews gave us valuable insight into our fledgling travel app idea. One of our main goals for this project was to make as few assumptions as possible, so we could create assets, applications, and experiences that were firmly user-centric and based in research. Below you will find summaries of our quantitative and qualitative research, quotes from our participants, and our key takeaways to include in the next steps of the project. </p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin">User research main goals </h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Before we set out writing surveys and interviews questions, we wanted to establish our main goals for our user research. The primary goal of our user research was to discover our users needs, how an experiential travel application could benefit Alaska Airlines, and we also wanted to try our hand at synthesising data. All of our initial goals can be seen below.</p>

				<h5 class="no-margin">Quantitative survey results</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">After this project, I am convinced writing survey questions is an art form. Trevor and I sent out four surveys total. The first survey tested whether our experience application idea was interesting to other people. After that assumption was validated, we wanted to know the demographic makeup of our users, as well as drill down into their travel habits, travel motivations, and travel pain points.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Information from the survey was surprising and informative. Users identified that when traveling food, culture and points of interest were the highest rated activities as well as money and time being the biggest challenges associated with traveling. I was also surprised to learn that nearly half of our sample size, choose destinations by word-of-mouth. The key takeaways from our surveys identified our initial pain points and travel experiences that were rated most valuable by our users.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that we had our quantitative data, we wrote our first interview questions. We set up a table on the first floor of Seattle Central College, and lured students in with the promise of free cookies. We talked to over fifty students, and sought to understand their pain points while traveling, their great experiences while traveling, and how experiences at their vacation destination shaped their feelings around traveling.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">From these interviews we were able to establish our five categories of experience offerings for our app: food and drink, outdoor adventure, historical excursions, locals only, and kid-friendly experiences. Affordability and connecting with friends and family was listed as the primary motivations for travel, and surprisingly, our participants generally did not use budgeting apps.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Noteworthy positive and negative experiences while traveling emerged throughout our interviews. Our participants valued comfort, safety, airline perks, and creating memories and experiences as being the most important while traveling, and transit delays, late flights, and technical mobile phone problems as being the biggest pain points.The main takeaways from our SCCA intrews can be found below.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Our next round of interviews involved speaking directly  to our target population. We made our way to the Sea-Tac light rail station to talk to travelers who had just returned to Seattle from a trip. We had a great response, with about 40 people being interviewed.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">We adjusted questions from our earlier interviews, and also added new questions to our script. We wanted to know how long people planned for trips and what was it like traveling with friends and family. Our participants planned their trips at varying times, but overall it seemed to fall into four categories. Travelers planned for less than three months, three to six months, six to nine months, and more than a year. No participants interviewed planned over two years in advance.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">In terms of traveling with friends and family, many of our participants reported having no conflict while traveling. However, some were more forthright and brought up scheduling conflicts, navigation struggles and general miscommunication as pain points.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Overall, many of the pain points our participants expressed were rooted in poor or miscommunication. Below is a summary of our interview findings as well as quotes from our participants.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph">The final step in our Carry On journey involved creating marketing collateral to inform our audience of our new application. We provided proof of concept for two social media ads, promotional cards (than can double as postcard mailers), and a promotional video featuring one of Alaska’s most popular destinations, Maui.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph">This step in the process felt more creative as we were able to lean into information we had gathered from our competitor analysis. From an early date, we wanted to use vibrant, aspirational, and large-scale imagery to convey adventure for Carry On’s experiences. In marketing, we focus on using destinations as the main selling point, continue the thread with Carry On colors, and use simple rectangular shapes to provide movement and contrast where necessary.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph">The last piece of the marketing material was a promotional video. I knew I wanted to pick a destination that is frequently traveled by Alaska, and a destination that has universal appeal. With those parameters in mind, I settled on featuring Maui in the video. The main goal of the promotional video is to show current and potential users what types of adventures they can experience with Carry On. The video is less informative, and more inspiring, as it uses imagery and video more that interviews and text. I love working with video, and video editing programs, so this deliverable was a joy to complete.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph">Carry On was the longest and biggest project I undertook at my time at SCCA. I am so proud that I could tackle a project from top to bottom, and produce deliverables that range from many design disciplines. I hope to create more work like this in the future. I want to work on projects that are validated by research and interviews, and not assumption. I would like to engage in competitor analysis frequently, as not to produce clones of other products and projects. Carry On allowed me the opportunity to try on many design hats, and improve my design thinking and strategy overall.</p>
