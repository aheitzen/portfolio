				<p class="projects-paragraph">The final step in our Carry On journey involved creating marketing collateral to inform our audience of our new application. We provided proof of concept for two social media ads, promotional cards (than can double as postcard mailers), and a promotional video featuring one of Alaskaâ€™s most popular destinations, Maui.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph">This step in the process felt more creative as we were able to lean into information we had gathered from our competitor analysis. From an early date, we wanted to use vibrant, aspirational, and large-scale imagery to convey adventure for Carry Onâ€™s experiences. In marketing, we focus on using destinations as the main selling point, continue the thread with Carry On colors, and use simple rectangular shapes to provide movement and contrast where necessary.</p>

The main goal of the promotional video is to show current and potential users what types of adventures they can experience with Carry On. The video is less informative, and more inspiring, as it uses imagery and video more that interviews and text. I love working with video, and video editing programs, so this deliverable was a joy to complete.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph">Carry On was the longest and biggest project I undertook at my time at SCCA. I am so proud that I could tackle a project from top to bottom, and produce deliverables that range from many design disciplines. I hope to create more work like this in the future. I want to work on projects that are validated by research and interviews, and not assumption. I would like to engage in competitor analysis frequently, as not to produce clones of other products and projects. Carry On allowed me the opportunity to try on many design hats, and improve my design thinking and strategy overall.</p>
