				<h5 class="no-margin">Mentorship and community</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The first steps in this project included reaching out to professionals in the experience and interaction community. We had several meetings over the course of nine months, but we met predomitly with UX researcher and strategist Laura Barboza and user experience and interface designer Courtney Comfort. Both designers asked pertinent questions about our idea, and how we planned to execute our research deliverables. These early meetings were instrumental in providing the foundation for this project.</p>

				<h5 class="no-margin">User experience research</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Our first steps in research involved creating a series of surveys. We conducted online research to identify the best way to craft survey questions, with limited bias. We posted our surveys to the SCCA student Slack channel, social media accounts, emailed to friends and family, and to the subreddit r/SampleSize. Our surveys regularly received over 50 responses per survey. As we were collecting this data we also rewrote certain questions and introduced new questions as the answers begin to trend or stagnate in a certain direction.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that we had quantitative research, we wanted to conduct in-person interviews, and also find a population that was rooted in the key demographic we were seeking, in this case travelers. We conducted our first round of in-person interviews on the first floor of SCCA, and talked to students and professors. We then went to Sea-Tac light rail station and talked to travelers who were making their way back into the city from a recent trip. Both rounds of intervening yielded informative results, with more overlap and similarity than expected.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin">User experience design</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that we had research data we needed to aggregate the data into something meaningful. We used a whiteboard and identified the most common needs, motivations and pain points from our participants and also closely analyzed participant quotes. Once we had a general sense of the data, we moved onto creating an affinity diagram to further consolidate and organize the results. From this research, we identified that our application should include five main features: help users select destinations based on their preferences and budget, recommend curated experiences at the destination, provide navigation in some capacity, include sharing and social media integration, and help users with common tips and tricks specific to their destination.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">From there, we completed a SWOT analysis to better understand the travel and experience landscape. We analyzed three companies, Airbnb, Tripadvisor, and Expedia. Next, we took our understanding of our user base and created four personas that represented the participants form our research. To better align ourselves to our personas we also completed an empathy map exercise. Lastly, we completed four customer journey maps for our four personas to better understand their needs, wants, motiavions, pain points, and opportunities.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin">User interface design</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Using research to inform our key features, simplified the prototyping process. Trevor and I divided the prototyping and used symbols in sketch to create unification. I designed the itinerary feature, that we synthesized from our personas, and Trevor designed the general booking process. We utilized complex reduction by using plenty of white-space and high-resolution aspirational images. After we had completed our lo-fi prototypes we implemented two rounds of user-testing to ensure our UI made sense.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">It was during this time we also cemented our final logo and color pallete. We experimented with illustrative marks with nods to traveling, but utlemay found them too kitschy. We instead settled on Sara Script for the primary logo, with Open Sans as the secondary type choice. We utilized Alaska Airlines recently rebranded color pallet and exchanged the light green for a vibrant pink. We wanted the color pallet to feel related to Alaska Airlines but differentiated.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin">Marketing</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The last step in the process was to identify and create marketing material for the app. I designed promotional cards, created a video, and made social media ads for Twitter and Facebook. The marketing and advertising space proved to be more creative and allowed focus on word play and sourcing beautiful images from around the globe.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<p class="projects-paragraph">Constructing online surveys and conducting in-person interviews gave us valuable insight into our fledgling travel app idea. One of our main goals for this project was to make as few assumptions as possible, so we could create assets, applications, and experiences that were firmly user-centric and based in research. Below you will find summaries of our quantitative and qualitative research, quotes from our participants, and our key takeaways to include in the next steps of the project. </p>

				<h5 class="no-margin">User research main goals </h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Before we set out writing surveys and interviews questions, we wanted to establish our main goals for our user research. The primary goal of our user research was to discover our users needs, how an experiential travel application could benefit Alaska Airlines, and we also wanted to try our hand at synthesising data. All of our initial goals can be seen below.</p>

				<h5 class="no-margin">Quantitative survey results</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">After this project, I am convinced writing survey questions is an art form. Trevor and I sent out four surveys total. The first survey tested whether our experience application idea was interesting to other people. After that assumption was validated, we wanted to know the demographic makeup of our users, as well as drill down into their travel habits, travel motivations, and travel pain points.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Information from the survey was surprising and informative. Users identified that when traveling food, culture and points of interest were the highest rated activities as well as money and time being the biggest challenges associated with traveling. I was also surprised to learn that nearly half of our sample size, choose destinations by word-of-mouth. The key takeaways from our surveys identified our initial pain points and travel experiences that were rated most valuable by our users.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that we had our quantitative data, we wrote our first interview questions. We set up a table on the first floor of Seattle Central College, and lured students in with the promise of free cookies. We talked to over fifty students, and sought to understand their pain points while traveling, their great experiences while traveling, and how experiences at their vacation destination shaped their feelings around traveling.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">From these interviews we were able to establish our five categories of experience offerings for our app: food and drink, outdoor adventure, historical excursions, locals only, and kid-friendly experiences. Affordability and connecting with friends and family was listed as the primary motivations for travel, and surprisingly, our participants generally did not use budgeting apps.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Noteworthy positive and negative experiences while traveling emerged throughout our interviews. Our participants valued comfort, safety, airline perks, and creating memories and experiences as being the most important while traveling, and transit delays, late flights, and technical mobile phone problems as being the biggest pain points.The main takeaways from our SCCA intrews can be found below.</p>

				<h5 class="no-margin">Sea-Tac airport | In-person interviews</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Our next round of interviews involved speaking directly  to our target population. We made our way to the Sea-Tac light rail station to talk to travelers who had just returned to Seattle from a trip. We had a great response, with about 40 people being interviewed.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">We adjusted questions from our earlier interviews, and also added new questions to our script. We wanted to know how long people planned for trips and what was it like traveling with friends and family. Our participants planned their trips at varying times, but overall it seemed to fall into four categories. Travelers planned for less than three months, three to six months, six to nine months, and more than a year. No participants interviewed planned over two years in advance.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">In terms of traveling with friends and family, many of our participants reported having no conflict while traveling. However, some were more forthright and brought up scheduling conflicts, navigation struggles and general miscommunication as pain points.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Overall, many of the pain points our participants expressed were rooted in poor or miscommunication. Below is a summary of our interview findings as well as quotes from our participants.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph">Carry On was the longest and biggest project I undertook at my time at SCCA. I am so proud that I could tackle a project from top to bottom, and produce deliverables that range from many design disciplines. I hope to create more work like this in the future. I want to work on projects that are validated by research and interviews, and not assumption. I would like to engage in competitor analysis frequently, as not to produce clones of other products and projects. Carry On allowed me the opportunity to try on many design hats, and improve my design thinking and strategy overall.</p>
