				<p class="projects-paragraph">The animation phase of the website was a multistep process. Taking illustrations from Illustrator, I brought them into After Effects and transformed them into shapes I could animate using keyframes. One of the surprising findings from this stage in the process was how important timing is in animation. I chose simple animations because my illustrations have many details. I also stayed away from large complex animation techniques as I wanted to keep the illustrations flat and in a 2-D space.  The animated assets in this project breathe life into the website, and create a unique viewing experience for the user. </p>
