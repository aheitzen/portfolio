				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">In the United States, birth control and emergency contraception access is dependent on location and local and federal legislation. Women who live in areas without reasonable access to a full-range of contraceptive services, reasonable access being one health clinic per 1,000 women, live in contraception deserts.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">Contraceptive deserts primarily impact poorer and more conservative areas in the United States, and shift the burden of finding healthcare onto vulnerable populations. In many cases, women who live in contraception deserts are unable to take time off work to drive hours to the nearest health clinic, and many cannot justify the cost of a multi-mile trip for access to reproductive healthcare.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">Under the Trump administration, contraception deserts are expected to rise, as the administration seeks to defund Title X. Title X are the only federally mandated funds dedicated towards helping low-income women receive access to birth control. Many of the remaining clinics near and in contraception deserts rely on Title X funding to remain open.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Given the impact of our current political climate, vulnerable populations who need access to affordable and accessible birth control, are currently being denied care. An opportunity exists to incorporate telemedicine and birth control delivery to ensure all women have access to contraception.</p>

This can expand income opportunities for healthcare workers as well as insurance providers and private practice physicians.</p>

				<h5 class="no-margin">Research and Interviews</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The first step in the process was to sit down and conduct in-person interviews. I met with two women who shared their experience and history with birth control. I posed questions about the quality of care from their physicians, which methods worked best/worse for them and why, and what their ideal system for obtaining birth control would be.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">One of the main takeaways from this process was birth control can be a process of trial and error. Both women expressed starting one method and having to switch due to side effects. This struck me as especially important, having access and communication with a doctor once you obtain your birth control and never feeling isolated around your health, felt important.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Other interesting takeaways included frustrations over not being heard by doctors, inappropriate comments from doctors and unclear communication of side-effects. See the quotes and comments from my interviews below.</p>

She is in a monogamous relationship, but lives in a contraception desert, with access to care being limited. She lives in a county where sex education is abrievated and is confused about birth control myths versus facts. She is uninsured, and cannot afford expensive birth control options.  Whitney needs guidance and information around what birth control options will work best for her body and lifestyle.</p>

She has been on the same birth control pill for almost a decade and is looking for a way to streamline her reproductive healthcare. She feels trealving to a doctors office wastes her time and money and is looking for a delivery service to replace her annual OB-GYN visit. She is also looking for higher quality doctors, as she is tired of not being heard or understood by her OB-GYN.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">With my new personas in hand, I sought to further align myself with their goals and pain points by creating empathy maps for the two primary personas, Whitney and Nikia.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The main takeaway for Whitney was a sense of fear around a new process. Having limited exposure to birth control can be overwhelming and isolating, especially with a lack of parental support. Creating an experience that is unpretentious and direct felt important for Whitney’s journey.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The main takeaway for Nikia involved efficiency. Nikia knows what she needs, and feels many roadblocks are in her way. She feels bogged down by the medical system and is looking for alternative solutions that compliment her lifestyle.</p>

Taking illustrations from Illustrator, I brought them into After Effects and transformed them into shapes I could animate using keyframes. One of the surprising findings from this stage in the process was how important timing is in animation. I chose simple animations because my illustrations have many details. I also stayed away from large complex animation techniques as I wanted to keep the illustrations flat and in a 2-D space.  The animated assets in this project breathe life into the website, and create a unique viewing experience for the user. </p>
