				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">The technological landscape is in a constant state of flux. For those of us who choose development and design work as our chosen profession, it can feel like a never ending spiral of new technologies, new buzzwords, and new jargon are being tossed around daily. This information gap also feeds the stereotype that designers and developers don’t understand each other, which can lead to stifling creative output.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">Open Source Magazine aims to demystify past and current development and design concepts, news, and history by creating an informed reader base that is up-to-date on the latest issues in the field. Open Source Magazine selects articles that will appeal and educate both front-end developers and designers, regardless of experience level, so that we may synergize our newfound understanding and knowledge and build something great together.</p>

				<h3 class="projects-h3-subheads" id="opportunity">The Opportunity</h3>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The primary opportunity for Open Source is to create a technology magazine that focuses specifically on UI design and development. Currently, science and technology magazines exist, but tend to focus on pop-science or more on science than technology. A gap exists in the current market for a front-end development and design magazine in print. Multitudes of tutorials and think-pieces are being published daily online on the topics of UI design and development, but sifting thought these articles on your own can be tedious, and invendablely you will miss out on helpful articles.</p>
				<!-- <p class="projects-paragraph-black">Open Source is narrow in it’s speciality but broad in its scope, as it reviews basics, but also explores new and emerging technology though interviews, featured articles, and tutorials. Open Source Magazine organizes the most pertinent articles to keep our readership informed.</p> -->
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The secondary opportunity is to create a magazine that can bridge the gap between development and design.  A stigma persists in the technology space that developers and designers do not understand each other. Open Source can remedy this tension by curating articles that appeal to both developers and designers, that can be easily understood by both.</p>

				<h5 class="no-margin">Research and Interviews</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Having previously worked in a development space, I knew I wanted to create a magazine that appealed to both development and design thinking. However, I was not sure if this topic was broad enough for a larger audience.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Over the summer, I met with my friends who work in both development and design and conducted in-person interviews, asking them what content would be relevant and interesting to them as readers. From those interviews, I was able to discern that virtual reality and augmented reality were popular topics as well as accessibility standards and application. With those subjects in mind, my next steps involved curated the articles for the magazine.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
		
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Content Sourcing:</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The next steps involved sourcing the articles, images, and advertisements that would be present in the magazine. Finding the content for the articles was fairly simple as I sourced articles from reputable sources online and found tutorials that were text heavy. Sourcing interviews was a surprisingly fun part of the process as I was able to learn about women in tech, and how their professional journeys unfolded. Lastly, I sourced images from high resolution photo sites like Unsplash and Pexels for the images throughout the magazine as well as tapping into archival advertisement photos saved from previous years projects.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Personas</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that my research and content sourcing was complete, it was time to synthesize findings from my research into my primary reader personas as well as map out the flatplan for the magazine. My personas reflect the varying experience, educational levels and occupations present in our readership.</p>

She is advanced with technology and needs to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in front-end development as well as increase her skills around design fundamentals, such as layout, color, and type.</p>

He needs reinforcement of basic design fundamentals as well as exposure to higher level tutorials and articles. He does not have an interest in development, but can see how it might be useful to know basic vocabulary for his future job. </p>

				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Flatplan</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that the readership for the magazine was defined, I started work on the flatplan. The flatplan in a magazine provides a general outline of how the issue will be laid out. The flatplan can be as simple or detailed as the designer chooses. As a living document, the flatplan can be updated and changed as the design solution emerges. </p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The flatplan for Open Source, demonstrates that full-page images are a design language commonly used throughout the magazine to create a sense of unity, while only adding advertisements as needed.</p>
