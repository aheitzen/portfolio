				<h5 class="no-margin">Research and Interviews</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The first steps in my research included finding websites that utilized animation, illustration and development in tandem. I was particularly drawn to websites that told stories and used illustration assets to support a narrative. I was less drawn to commercial or retail websites.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Wanting to focus on something effervescent, I brainstormed what content would allow me to complete this website given the abbreviated timeframe. I have always had an interest in zodiac signs, and I saw a great opportunity to my foster my illustration skills by drawing humans and animals. With my web direction and content solidified, the next phase was bringing my ideas to life.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The animation and illustration process was not a linear learning experience. I started to express ideas in illustrator, and began to iron out what shapes, colors, and illustration style I would use. I began drawing circles with different stroke weights and landed on a series of orbits that would act as secondary elements. I chose colors that were reminiscent of the night sky, and used a mythical typeface as my primary type to lean into the mysticism and magic around the zodiac.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Once I had my layout solved, I began to illustrate Aries, the ram. I spent more time in the beginning stages of illustration, figuring out which illustration style would be most efficient during the animation process. I landed on stroke illustrations that would could let the stars from the background of the site move through the illustrations. After I had successfully drawn Aries, and the associated zodiac symbol, I exported the file and brought it into After Effects.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">In After Effects, I converted my artwork using trim paths to have access to every stroke path from the illustrations. Using keyframes, I began to animate the paths individually at varying times. This was the part of the process that took the longest, as I was still new to After Effects. By repeating the process from above I was able to illustrate and animate in a quarter of the time as I worked my way through the zodiac. Once I was at Leo, I had the process down pat.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph">The animation phase of the website was a multistep process. Taking illustrations from Illustrator, I brought them into After Effects and transformed them into shapes I could animate using keyframes. One of the surprising findings from this stage in the process was how important timing is in animation. I chose simple animations because my illustrations have many details. I also stayed away from large complex animation techniques as I wanted to keep the illustrations flat and in a 2-D space.  The animated assets in this project breathe life into the website, and create a unique viewing experience for the user. </p>
